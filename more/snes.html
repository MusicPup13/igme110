        <section>While SNES may have been a fan-favorite, that is mainly inpart due to the fact that it had amazing and ground-breaking 
            games. Things like Earthbound, Link to the Past and many others, Nintendo has always been known for their games. SNES was 
            known for the amazing games they had that are considered by some to be the best in their respective series or genre of game. 
            Genesis on the other hand didn't really have much in regards to games besides sports and fighting and arcade. SNES blew Genesis 
            out of the water when it came to games but that was about it. Also that is in part because it was appealing to a broad demographic 
            that typically caters to all ages which means they would make more money.
