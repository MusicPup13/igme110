        <section>Genesis managed to stay ahead of the SNES in sales and appealed to an older demographic to help stay in the marketplace and 
            eventually helped other companies with creating games and consoles to appeal to older demographics. Sega targeted mainly teenagers 
            who had played on aracade machines which helped the sales since they weren't competing in the same demographic as Nintendo which gave
             them a huge advantage. Genesis had elaborate technology that was ahead of its time and helped set the framework for consoles of the 
            future to improve and implement into later systems. The Genesis had backwards compatability, wireless controllers, SEGA Channel, and 
            so many more things that made Genesis so ahead of its time. Genesis helped create new game genres and breathed new life into classic 
            arcade games. Genesis was responsible for the rise in popularity for beat-um-ups and sports games.
