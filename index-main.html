        <section>As many of you know there has been a long standing debate on which was more influential in gaming, the SNES or the SEGA Genesis.
            This was mainly inpart due to the two being the first 16-bit consoles on the market and were incredible for their time. I know that making this
             website will likely end in people hating me which is why I don't have much personal information here so people can't attack me. This is all my 
            opinions. If you would like to know more about each side's influence in the gaming world, please click the links below to find out more about each.
